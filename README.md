This will eventually be a game engine in Swift using Metal.
  
Somethings work but it's definitely not ready. It's based off of SpriteKit so if you know that API this should be (will be) pretty straight forward to use.

Should you use it? Probably not. I was having some performance issues using SpriteKit and I think (hope) this will address those issues but I don't know what I'm doing really. This will also never be as robust as SpriteKit as I have fairly specific needs.
