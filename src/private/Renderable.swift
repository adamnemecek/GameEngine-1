/**
 The `Renderable` protocol is required by an object that wishes to be rendered. Applying this protocol to an object should be sufficient for creating a custom pipeline.

 The following base classes conform to this protocol:
 - ShapeNode
 - SpriteNode
 - TextNode
 
 - discussion: Currently, this doesn't need to be public as there's no way to add a custom `Pipeline` to the `Renderer` at some point I will expose that.
               I'm just not entirely sure how I want to do it yet.
 
 - seealso: `NodeGeometry` and `Tree`
