/**
 The `Renderable` protocol is required by an object that wishes to be rendered. Applying this protocol to an object should be sufficient for creating a custom pipeline.

 The following base classes conform to this protocol:
 - ShapeNode
 - SpriteNode
 - TextNode
 
 - discussion: Currently, this doesn't need to be public as there's no way to add a custom `Pipeline` to the `Renderer` at some point I will expose that.
               I'm just not entirely sure how I want to do it yet.
 
 - seealso: `NodeGeometry` and `Tree`

   is by updating their size using the default implementation of updateSize in `NodeGeometry`.

   - note: All the default renderable objects only have 4 vertices in a rectangular shape.
   
   - warning: For the default renderable objects, the size of this is buffer is the exact size required and therefore should not be updated
              after this object has been added to the draw loop. Currently, it's not a big deal I don't think, but that may change at some point.
